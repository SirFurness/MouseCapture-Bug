# Mouse Capture Bug

Mouse down on one of the text components.
Drag the mouse outside of the text component.
Mouse up/Release the mouse.

From the code this should result in "left" being printed, but instead there is a lot of inconsistency. Sometimes "left" is printed, sometimes "right" is printed.
